## 🐍 Python Projects

### Natural Language Processing: Creating a 'Netflix Recommendation System' in Python with spaCy

The objective of this project is to develop a Netflix recommendation system using natural language processing techniques in Python. The system compares the similarity between a given movie description and a collection of other movie descriptions to generate personalised recommendations.
