## ðŸ”­ Projects

### Creating a game using a single-header C++ library for making simple 2D games
RunRight, is a side-scrolling jump and beat-em-up game developed using [SumoDigital's Playbuffer](https://github.com/sumo-digital-academy/playbuffer), a single-header C++ library for making simple 2D games.

- Repository: [RunRight C++ Game](https://github.com/AdiPun/Playbuffer-RunRight)

### Natural Language Processing: Creating a 'Netflix Recommendation System' in Python with spaCy

The objective of this project is to develop a Netflix recommendation system using natural language processing techniques in Python. The system compares the similarity between a given movie description and a collection of other movie descriptions to generate personalised recommendations.

### HyperionDev bootcamp tasks

These are all the tasks that I completed with HyperionDev's Data Science Bootcamp.
These serve as a portfolio and as a reminder to myself of where I started :)
